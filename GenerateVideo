This directory is intended as a gradual introduction to animation
using the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL).

The usual progression for viewing the files in the directories should be:
  (0) go back and review the simple blit example.
  (1) drawOn -- blitting a sprite onto another sprite
  (2) cpuAnim -- an animation that uses the cpu clock rather than
      the SDL game clock.
  (3) gameClockAnim -- this animation uses the distance formula, 
      and the SDL game clock to generate a smooth animation that
      runs the same on all platforms and computers.
  (4) smoothAnim -- this one's the best
